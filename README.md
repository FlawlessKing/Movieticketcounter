A modern, extensible kiosk system built with enterprise-grade C++ technologies. The system leverages:

- **Conan** for robust package management
- **gRPC with Protocol Buffers** for efficient client-server communication  
- **PostgreSQL** for reliable data persistence
- **Buf Schema Registry** for proto definition management
